Project Plan: Hospital Management System (PHP & MySQL)
Project Goal: To develop a secure, scalable, and comprehensive Hospital Management System (HMS) using raw PHP and a MySQL database, covering all specified departmental modules and operational requirements.

Development Methodology: Agile, with development organized into sprints to allow for iterative progress, testing, and feedback.

Recommended Tools:

Version Control: Git (with a repository on GitHub, GitLab, or similar)

Dependency Management: Composer

Development Environment: XAMPP or WAMP

Project Management: Jira, Trello, or Asana

Testing: PHPUnit

Phase 0: Foundation & Planning (Estimated Timeline: 1 Week)

Objectives:

Establish a clean and modern project structure.

Set up the development environment and version control.

Define core coding standards.

Key Tasks:

Define Project Scope: Finalize the list of core features for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).   

Setup Version Control: Initialize a Git repository with a clear branching strategy (e.g., main, develop, feature/*).   

Configure Development Environment: Ensure all developers have a consistent local server environment (Apache, PHP 7.4+, MySQL).   

Initialize Composer: Set up composer.json to manage dependencies and configure PSR-4 autoloading for the src/ directory.   

Create Project Structure: Build the directory structure as outlined in the technical strategy (e.g., /public, /src, /config, /tests).   

Deliverables:

Initialized Git repository.

A composer.json file with PSR-4 autoloading configured.

A complete, empty directory structure for the project.

Phase 1: Core Architecture & Database (Estimated Timeline: 2-3 Weeks)
This phase is critical for building the application's non-functional backbone. All future development will rely on the stability and security of this core.

Objectives:

Design a normalized and efficient database schema.

Develop the system's central services for security, notifications, and logging.

Key Tasks:

Database Design:

Create a detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for all modules.   

Write and validate the CREATE TABLE SQL scripts for the entire database, ensuring normalization (3NF) and referential integrity with foreign keys.   

Implement Front Controller: Set up /public/index.php as the single entry point for all requests.   

Develop Authentication & RBAC Engine:

Build the user login system using secure password hashing (password_hash()).   

Implement a session management system.

Create the database tables and logic for Roles and Permissions based on the defined matrix.

Build Core Services:

Develop a centralized Notification Service (stubbed for now, to be integrated with email/SMS later).

Create a robust Auditing/Logging mechanism to track critical system events.

Deliverables:

Complete SQL schema file (database.sql).

A functional user login/logout system.

Core classes for RBAC, Notifications, and Logging.

Phase 2: Foundational Modules (Estimated Timeline: 3-4 Weeks)
With the core architecture in place, development begins on the modules that manage the system's primary entities: patients and staff.

Objectives:

Develop the modules for managing patient and staff records.

Establish the basic patient workflow of registration and appointment scheduling.

Sprint 2.1: HR Management

Tasks:

Build the interface for the HR Manager to add/manage staff records.

Create functionality to link staff records to user accounts and assign roles.

Implement credential and license tracking features.   

Deliverable: A functional HR module for staff management.

Sprint 2.2: Patient Administration & Appointments

Tasks:

Develop the patient registration form and logic (Outdoor/New Patient).

Build the core Electronic Medical Record (EMR) view to display patient data.

Create the appointment scheduling system for receptionists to book appointments between patients and doctors.   

Deliverable: A functional Patient Administration module where patients can be registered and appointments can be scheduled.

Phase 3: Clinical & Logistics Modules (Estimated Timeline: 4-6 Weeks)
This phase expands the system to cover the core clinical and inpatient workflows.

Objectives:

Manage the inpatient journey from admission to bed allocation.

Digitize the operation theater and pharmacy workflows.

Sprint 3.1: Inpatient & Bed Management

Tasks:

Build the real-time bed management dashboard (viewing bed status).   

Implement the Admission, Discharge, Transfer (ADT) functionality, linking it to the Patient Administration module.   

Deliverable: A system to admit patients and assign them to a specific bed.

Sprint 3.2: Operation Theater (OT) Management

Tasks:

Develop the surgical scheduling interface, including conflict checking.   

Implement resource management (staff, equipment) and pre-operative checklists.   

Deliverable: A functional OT scheduling and management module.

Sprint 3.3: Pharmacy Management

Tasks:

Build the e-prescribing interface for doctors within the patient's EMR.

Develop the pharmacy-side inventory management system (stock levels, expiration dates).   

Create the dispensing workflow for pharmacists.

Deliverable: An integrated pharmacy module to manage prescriptions and drug inventory.

Phase 4: Financial & Supply Chain Modules (Estimated Timeline: 4-5 Weeks)
This phase focuses on the business and operational backbone of the hospital.

Objectives:

Automate the hospital's procurement and inventory processes.

Develop a comprehensive billing system that integrates with all other modules.

Sprint 4.1: Purchasing & Warehousing

Tasks:

Build the supplier management and purchase order system.   

Develop the warehousing module for tracking non-pharmaceutical supplies.   

Implement the stock requisition process for departments.

Deliverable: A complete supply chain management system.

Sprint 4.2: Accounts & Billing

Tasks:

Develop the charge-capturing mechanism to receive billable events from Pharmacy, OT, Bed Management, etc.

Build the patient billing and invoicing system.   

Implement payment processing and insurance management features.

Deliverable: A fully integrated accounts module capable of generating a final patient bill.

Phase 5: System-Wide Integration & Testing (Estimated Timeline: 3-4 Weeks)
This phase is dedicated to ensuring the application is stable, secure, and ready for users.

Objectives:

Perform comprehensive testing to ensure all modules work together seamlessly.

Conduct security and performance audits.

Get feedback from end-users.

Key Tasks:

Integration Testing: Test the full patient journey data flow, from registration to billing and discharge.

Performance Optimization: Analyze and optimize slow database queries using EXPLAIN. Implement caching strategies (OPcache, Redis/Memcached) for frequently accessed data.   

Security Hardening: Conduct a thorough security review. Test for SQL injection, XSS, and access control vulnerabilities.   

User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Provide key hospital staff (as per the defined roles) with access to a staging server to test workflows and provide feedback.

Deliverables:

A comprehensive test report (unit, integration, and UAT results).

A performance and security audit report.

A stable, tested, and user-approved application on a staging server.

Phase 6: BI, Deployment & Post-Launch (Estimated Timeline: 2-3 Weeks)
The final phase involves launching the application and providing tools for strategic analysis.

Objectives:

Deploy the application to a live production environment.

Develop the analytics dashboard for hospital management.

Provide training and documentation.

Key Tasks:

BI & Analytics Module:

Define and calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Bed Occupancy Rate, ALOS, etc..   

Build the executive, clinical, and operational dashboards.   

Deployment:

Configure the production server environment.

Deploy the application code and run the database schema.

Perform final smoke testing on the live server.
